The escalating demand for cellular infrastructure innovation is driven by
the rapid increase in users. Densely deploying conventional base stations
(CBSs) and managing smart backhaul/fronthaul networks are key strategies
to meet this demand. However, urban landscapes and fading environments
pose challenges for terrestrial backhaul hubs. This article proposes leveraging
an aerial network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to replace terrestrial
backhaul networks, ensuring effective fronthaul connectivity between CBSs
and the ground core network (GCN). To optimize the systemâ€™s sum rate, the
research focuses on UAV positioning and CBS association. Considering com-
munication constraints like backhaul data rates, power limits, bandwidth,
connections to UAVs, interference thresholds, and UAV altitudes is crucial
in formulating the CBS association problem with UAVs. Various techniques
such as k-means, k-medoids, and genetic algorithms (GA) are employed to
tackle this optimization challenge, supplemented by real-world CBS data for
validation. The practical evaluation of these methods with real-world data
demonstrates their effectiveness in optimizing smart fronthaul networks to
meet evolving cellular communication needs.
